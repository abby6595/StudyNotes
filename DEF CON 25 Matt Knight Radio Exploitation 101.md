# DEF CON 25 - Matt Knight - Radio Exploitation 101

* They aimed at the physical and Mac layers of wireless communication systems. They what to demystify really what's happening in the wireless domain. How you can use great open source software and hardware to abstract a lot of the complexity. 他們最愛的工具叫做「New radio」
    * Companion flow graph 讓你能夠拖放開源訊號處理模塊並實作自己的收發器發射機

1. The development of Wired and Wireless security technology
2. Introduce some key RF concepts which are pretty light just enough to frame the rest of the discussion
3. The methods of wireless exploitation they have looked at a number of high profile attacks from the last couple years
    * They categorized them
    * Broken them out in terms of the mechanics of how the attack is performed
    * Emphasizing analogs (類似的攻擊) that exist on wired networks

###########

* Network security asministrator in the 1990s will really concerned about two protocols which are Ethernet and token ring.

* 1998 ethereal (Wireshark) comes out 便宜又容易上手
* 2000s protocol map 變得更複雜了 802.3 802.5，Software defined radios are proprietary(Expensive)
* 2012 Aunty (a hacker) dvb-t-over-the-air receier which is a USB stick that you can plug in TV 然後在電腦上看
* 2017 Software defined radios are totally commodity, 價格多變，駭客取得容易，造成無線網路安全的革命以及能夠 look into these proprietary protocols 
    * 802.11 成為涉及 RF 安全的一塊部分，mobile and IoT 的成長，出現了許多不同的應用？每一種應用都有其 physical layer. 其中有不少應用都與嵌入式系統有關。


## Embedded System
這種系統非常複雜。甚至有的遷入式系統會加進 concrete 水泥

## Attacks
Wireshark to look at layor to traffic from 802.11 networks

## RF
### Physical layer 是我們網路架構模型的最底層
    * 以有線網路來說則是1s, 0s 如何 mapped into voltage timing 電壓時序 and wiring kind of the physical properties 佈線類型的物理特性，強調溝通標準
    * 對無線網路來說則是 1s, 0s, 如何 mapped into patterns of energy they're being sent over the RF medium 透過 RF 介質來傳送的能量模式 (a waveform)
        * RF is the electromagnetic spectrum 電磁頻譜
        * Waveform then gets run through an RF front end which could include some filtering and some gain stages to make it (the wave) more powerful and then it gets pushed out to an antenna and it goes out into the electromagnetic spectrum into the RF medium that carries it to its destination.
        * The receiver: the waveform gets picked up by the antenna it gets run through demodulator and that produces a stream of bits that wind up in the physical layer state machine. 
            * Physical air state machine: Spins on that stream of information coming from the demodulator and presents a layer to frame back up to your host.(?)

### Modulation
Modulation is the fuction that map's how those digital values get mapped into RF energy which is the core element of the wireless physical layer.



- Hardware defind radio (Wi-fi adapter): the logic that makes it speak 802.11 is 被燒成芯片中的矽
- Radios = state machines(?)

- 不同的 RF Physical layer 的 spectrogram 很不一樣（如何產生以及如何在空中 communicate)，無法用 Wi-Fi adapter communicate with it -> 用 Software Defined radio (a flexible generic reconfigurable radio 靈活通用的可重組radio 前端)。All the logic that defines how the protocol operates so whether it's 802.11 or Bluetooth or some proprietary protocol this all exists in software.
    - Instead of having one h/w to find radio for every different protocol you can have one s/w-defined radio and simply change your software on your host computer to speak these different protocols.
    - You can change the center frequency 中心頻率
    - change the channel bandwidth which is how much data you're pulling down
    - stream this raw radio data either to an FPGA or your host computer
    - Downside to s/w defined radio: it can be fairly complex. The example image on the left is RTL from a 802.15 for s/w-defined radio decoder that Matt implemented.

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you write a program to set environment variables on your Mac:

Choose a Scripting Language: For our purposes, we will use a shell script (bash).

Create the Script:

Open the Terminal on your Mac (you can find it in the Applications â†’ Utilities folder).
Navigate to a directory where you want to create the script. For instance, if you want to create it in your home directory, just type cd ~.
Use a text editor to create the script. You can use nano for simplicity: nano setenv.sh.
Write the Script:

In the editor, paste or type the following:

`#!/bin/bash

# Setting environment variables
export MY_VARIABLE="This is a test variable."
# Add more environment variables using the export command as needed`

Save and Exit:

If you're using nano:

Press CTRL + O to write the changes.
Press Enter to confirm.
Press CTRL + X to exit the editor.

Make the Script Executable:

Still in the terminal, make your script executable by running:
`chmod +x setenv.sh`

chmod is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that stands for "change mode". 
It is used to set or modify the permissions associated with files and directories. 
These permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a given file or directory.

Using Numeric Mode:
You can set permissions using octal (base-8) notation:

4: read (r)
2: write (w)
1: execute (x)
For example:

`chmod 755 filename` sets the permissions of filename to rwxr-xr-x. 
Here, the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, while the group and others only have read and execute permissions.
